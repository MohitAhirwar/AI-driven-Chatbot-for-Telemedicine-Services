Context,Answer
What is a coronavirus?,Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.Â 
What is a coronavirus?,"In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases"
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Â 
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How does COVID-19 spread?,People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.Â 
How does COVID-19 spread?,People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Â 
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,"Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. "
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth."

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"If possible, avoid traveling to places Â â€“ especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely).
What can I do to protect myself andProtection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading prevent the spread of disease?,"Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover."
Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading,"If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you Â are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go."
Should I worry about COVID-19,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care."
Should I worry about COVID-19,"We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities."
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Â "
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.Â 
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.Â "
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.Â "
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?",Those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?",Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
Should I wear a mask to protect myself,Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once.
Should I wear a mask to protect myself,If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.Â 
Should I wear a mask to protect myself,"There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water"
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,The â€œincubation periodâ€ means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease.
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
Can humans be infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people."
Can humans be infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. 
Can humans be infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. Â

Can humans be infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"While there has beenÂ one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, toÂ date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others."
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.Â "
Is there anything I should not do?,Smoking
Is there anything I should not do?,Wearing multiple masks
Is there anything I should not do?,Taking antibiotics
Is the source causing COVID-19 known?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans.Â "
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing."
Is COVID-19 airborne?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. "
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,At present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population.
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty breathing) to their healthcare provider."

Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn baby?,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk."
What care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"All pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth.Â "
Do pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to give birth by ceasarean section?,No. WHO advice is that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified.
Can women with COVID-19 breastfeed?,Yes. Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so.
Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?,"Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. "
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"Both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus.
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed."

Are smokers and tobacco users at higher risk of COVID-19 infection?,Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth.
Are smokers and tobacco users at higher risk of COVID-19 infection?,"Smoking products such as water pipes often involve the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings."
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a â€œmass gatheringâ€?,High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings.
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a â€œmass gatheringâ€?,An event counts as a â€œmass gatheringsâ€ if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place.Â 
Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ.Â "

What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?,"However, in most cases these studies provided no information on the specific conditions identified as risk factors for the increased risk of COVID-19 The data were used to identify risk factors for the increased risk among physicians who were physicians in the USA in 2015and in Canada in 2015 However, in most cases these studies provided no information on the specific conditions identified as risk factors for the increased risk of COVID-19"
What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis."
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, â€˜COâ€™ stands for â€˜corona,â€™ â€˜VIâ€™ for â€˜virus,â€™ and â€˜Dâ€™ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as â€œ2019 novel coronavirusâ€ or â€œ2019-nCoVâ€.

There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases."
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem."
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,"People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma."
What is the source of the virus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus."
How does the virus spread?,"This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. Itâ€™s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (â€œcommunity spreadâ€) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses."
Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:

The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including refrigerated or frozen food?","Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19."
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?,This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily. The latest updates are available on CDCâ€™s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
What should I do if I had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online."
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness including older adults, and people who have serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease."
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19."
Does CDC recommend the use of facemask to prevent COVID-19?,"CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility)."
Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?,"There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we donâ€™t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available."
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Read about COVID-19 Symptoms."
Should I be tested for COVID-19?,"If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild. If you have severe symptoms, such as persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips of face, contact your healthcare provider or emergency room and seek care immediately. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested."
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the personâ€™s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.

For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness."
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem."
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,"People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma."
What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?,"For recommendations and guidance on persons under investigation; infection control, including personal protective equipment guidance; home care and isolation; and case investigation, see Information for Healthcare Professionals. For information on specimen collection and shipment, see Information for Laboratories. For information for public health professional on COVID-19, see Information for Public Health Professionals."
Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?,There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.
Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).

Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled."
What do Funeral Home Workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?,"A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.

Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the CDCâ€™s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).

After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases."
What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas?,"When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased personâ€™s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of Stateâ€™s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance."
My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States?,"CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceasedâ€™s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.

CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.

At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:

The remains are cremated; OR
The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR
The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.
Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov.
Please see CDCâ€™s guidance for additional information."
What is CDC doing about COVID-19?,"This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect peopleâ€™s health. More information about CDCâ€™s response to COVID-19 is available online."
What about imported animals or animal products?,"CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulatesexternal icon animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulatesexternal icon importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources."
Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Please refer to CDCâ€™s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States. The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from China, a high-risk country for rabies."
Should I be concerned about pets or other animals and COVID-19?,"While this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person-to-person in China. There is no reason to think that any animals including pets in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals including pets can spread COVID-19. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâ€™s always a good idea to wash your hands after being around animals. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCâ€™s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website."
Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask"
"What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported (for example, by shelters, rescue groups, or as personal pets) from China?","Animals imported from China will need to meet CDC and USDA requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals including pets can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported from China should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently in China."
Should I cancel my international trip?,"CDC provides recommendations for international travel, including guidance on when to consider postponing or canceling travel. Most of the time, this guidance is provided through travel health notices and is based on the potential health risks associated with traveling to a certain destination.

Travel health notices are designated as Level 1, 2, or 3, depending on the situation in that destination. (See below for what each level means). A list of destinations with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) travel health notices is available at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html.

Warning Level 3: CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to these destinations.
Alert Level 2: CDC recommends older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions consider postponing nonessential travel.
Watch Level 1: CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to destinations with, but it is important to take steps to prevent getting and spreading diseases during travel.
CDC also recommends all travelers, defer all cruise travel worldwide. This is particularly important for older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions.

If you do travel, take the following steps to help reduce your chances of getting sick:

Avoid contact with sick people.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
Make sure you are up to date with your routine vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and CDC guidance is reviewed daily and updated frequently.


"
Are international layovers included in CDC's recommendation to avoid nonessential travel?,"Yes. Airport layovers in international destinations with a level 3 travel health notice are included in CDCâ€™s recommendation to avoid nonessential travel. If a layover is unavoidable, CDC recommends you not leave the airport. Even if you donâ€™t leave the airport during your layover, you may still be subject to screening and monitoring when entering the United States.

A layover is anytime you exit a plane when traveling to your final destination."
What is the risk of getting COVID-19 on an airplane?,"Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily. Although the risk of infection on an airplane is low, try to avoid contact with sick passengers and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

For more information: Exposure Risk During Travel"
What happens if there is a sick passenger on an international or domestic flight?,"Under current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a US destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered to be a public health risk, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to contact passengers and crew exposed to that sick traveler.

Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight.

For more information: Contact Investigation"
Should I go on a cruise?,"CDC recommends all travelers, particularly older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships."
Should travelers wear facemasks?,"CDC does not recommend that healthy travelers wear facemasks to protect themselves from COVID-19. Wear a facemask only if you are sick and coughing or sneezing to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses to others. If you are well, it is more important to take these important steps to reduce your chances of getting sick:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
To the extent possible, avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places â€“ elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people, etc.
Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something.
Wash your hands after touching surfaces in public places.
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water arenâ€™t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol."
What can I expect when departing other countries?,"Be aware that some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health."
What can I expect when arriving to the United States?,"At this time, travel restrictions and entry screening only apply to travelers arriving from countries with a level 3 travel health notice. [Note: US policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.]

This means that if you traveled from countries other than those listed above, you:

Wonâ€™t be subject to additional health screening upon arrival in the United States, and
Wonâ€™t be under mandatory quarantine orders upon entry to the United States.
If you are arriving to the United States from a country with level 2 travel health notice, you will be asked to monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.

If you are coming from an international destination with a level 3 Travel Health Notice, you will be asked to stay home for 14 days from the time you return from travel, monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible."
How are travelers from countries with a level 3 travel health notice being screened when they enter the United States?,"At this time, American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and family members (as specified in the Presidential Proclamationexternal icon) who have been in countries with a Level 3 travel health notice within 14 days prior to their arrival will be allowed to enter the United States. Travelers from some countries with a level 3 travel health notice are being re-directed to certain airports and are screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or trouble breathing and asked questions about their travel and possible exposure to COVID-19. Travelers without symptoms will be told to stay home and practice social distancing.

More information for travelers from countries with a level 3 travel health notice is available here."
After arriving from a country with a level 3 travel health notice related to COVID-19 when can I return to work?,"Currently, any traveler arriving to the United States after leaving a country with Level 3 travel health notice related to COVID-19 in the past 14 days will have some level of restrictions on their movements. All travelers from these countries should stay home and practice social distancing for 14 days from the time they left the outbreak area.

Foreign nationals who have visited China, Iran, and most European Countries in the past 14 days are temporarily not allowed to enter the United States."
What if I recently traveled and get sick?,See CDCâ€™s website about what to do if you get sick.
How can my family and I prepare for COVID-19?,"Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:

Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community.
Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications, particularly older adults and those with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease.
Make sure they have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected.
Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources.
Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources."
What steps can my family take to reduce our risk of getting COVID-19?,"Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects
(e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles)."
What should I do if someone in my house gets sick with COVID-19?,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. In adults, emergency warning signs*:
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face
*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptom that is severe or concerning.
Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
Clean hands regularly by handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks."
"How can I prepare in case my child's school, childcare facility, or university is dismissed?","Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schoolâ€™s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak."
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19."
Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?,"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDCâ€™s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection."
What should I do if there is an outbreak in my community?,"During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:

Protect yourself and others.

Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).
Put your household plan into action.

Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your householdâ€™s daily routine.
Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childâ€™s school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions."
How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults."
What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?,"This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your childâ€™s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community."
Will schools be dismissed if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childâ€™s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friendâ€™s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall."
Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childâ€™s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDCâ€™s current Risk Assessment page."
How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing)
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
Launder items including washable plush toys as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other peopleâ€™s items.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Itâ€™s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
What about pregnant women?,"There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. That said, current evidence suggests that severity of illness among pregnant women after COVID-19 infection is similar to that in non-pregnant adult COVID-19 cases, and there is no data that suggests infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby occurring during pregnancy. ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice."
Is there a treatment for the COVID-19Â disease?,"There is no specific treatment for this disease, so healthcare providers treat the clinical symptoms (e.g. fever, difficulty breathing) of patients. Supportive care (e.g. fluid management, oxygen therapy etc.) can be highly effective for patients with symptoms."
When should I be tested for COVID-19?,"Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Countries across the EU/EEA might be in different scenarios, even within the same country, and testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level.

National authorities may decide to only test subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or any other criteria. As a rational approach, national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups:

hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;
cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals in order to assess the extent of virus circulation in the population;
elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions"
Where can I get tested?,"If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or tiredness) it is recommended that you contact healthcare services by telephone or online. If your healthcare provider believes there is a need for a laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19, he/she will inform you of the procedure to follow and advise where and how the test can be performed."
How can I avoid getting infected?,"The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.

Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings.

It is also recommended to stay 1 metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms, to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets."
What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"Notify public health authorities in your area who will provide guidance on further steps to take. If you develop any symptoms, you should immediately call your healthcare provider for advice, mentioning that you have been in contact with someone with COVID-19."
Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?,"If you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people, but there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from being infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes."
Is there a vaccine against the virus?Â How long will it take to develop a vaccine?,"There are currently no vaccines against human coronaviruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19. This is why it is very important to prevent infection and to contain further spread of the virus.

The development of vaccines takes time. Several pharmaceutical companies are working on vaccine candidates. It will, however, take months or years before any vaccine can be widely used, as it needs to undergo extensive testing to determine its safety and efficacy. "
Am I protected against COVID-19Â if I had the influenza vaccine this year?,Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses and the seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect against COVID-19.  
How prepared is Europe for COVID-19Â and what is the EU doing?,"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is in continuous contact with the European Commission and the World Health Organization regarding the assessment of this outbreak. To inform the European Commission and the public health authorities in Member States of the ongoing situation, ECDC publishes daily summaries and continuously assesses the risk for EU citizens. ECDC and WHO have developed technical guidance to support the EU Member States in their response. The European Commission is ensuring the coordination of risk management activities at EU level."
Am I at risk of contracting COVID-19Â infection in the EU?,This outbreak is evolving rapidly and the risk assessment is changing accordingly. ECDC is continuously assessing the risk for EU citizens and you can find the latest information in the daily updated ECDC risk assessment.
How many people have been infected in the EU/EEA?,"See the ECDC daily situation update for the latest available information. Given the extensive movement of people and the fact that the virus is transmitted from person to person, further cases are expected in Europe."
How long will this outbreak last?,"Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict how long the outbreak will last and how the epidemic will unfold. We are dealing with a new virus and therefore a lot of uncertainty remains. For instance, it is not known whether transmission within the EU/EEA will naturally decrease during the northern hemisphere summer, as is observed for seasonal influenza.
"
Should schools and day centres be closed?,"The evidence we have to date indicates that COVID-19 does not affect children nearly as much as it affects adults. However, the extent to which children play a role in the transmission of the virus is still unknown. Due to this uncertainty, it is especially important to encourage children to wash their hands carefully to reduce any possible risk of them becoming infected themselves, and then of passing on the virus. If children do become ill, they should be strictly isolated at home.

Depending on local circumstances, local authorities may decide to temporarily close schools and daycare centres to reduce transmission. Wherever this happens, it is important that parents and caregivers are supported, for example by their employers, so they can stay at home and take care of their children.
"
What precautions should I take if I am visiting an area of local or community transmission?,"Travellers visiting areas of local or community COVID-19 transmission should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously."
What if I have recently been in an area of local or community transmission?,"Travellers returning from areas of local or community transmission should monitor their health for 14 days. People with symptoms should contact their healthcare specialist via telephone first, and indicate their exposure and travel history before seeking medical attention in person. Symptomatic people should avoid contact with others until they have received advice from a healthcare specialist."
What is the risk of infection when travelling by plane?,"If it is established that a COVID-19 case has been on an airplane, other passengers who were at risk (as defined by how near they were seated to the infected passenger) will be contacted by public health authorities. Should you have questions about a flight you have taken, please contact your local health authority for advice. The risk of being infected on an airplane cannot be excluded, but is currently considered to be low for an individual traveller. The risk of being infected in an airport is similar to that of any other place where many people gather.
"
Why are people not being checked for COVID-19Â at the airport when arriving from areas of local or community transmission?,"There is evidence that checking people at the airport (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.
"
Where can I learn more?,"Each EU/EEA country may issue specific advice to travellers to areas with local or community transmission of COVID-19. Consult your local health authority or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get advice tailored for residents in your setting. 

For an updated list of areas of presumed community transmission, please refer to WHO situation reports for country classification."
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from animals or animal products imported from affected areas?,"There is no evidence that any of the animals or animal products authorised for entry into the European Union pose a risk to the health of EU citizens as a result of the presence of COVID-19.

"
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from food products imported from affected areas?,"There has been no report of transmission of COVID-19 via food and therefore there is no evidence that food items imported into the European Union in accordance with the applicable animal and public health regulations pose a risk for the health of EU citizens in relation to COVID-19. The main mode of transmission is from person to person.

"
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from contact with pets and other animals in the EU?,"Current research links COVID-19 to certain types of bat as the original source, but does not exclude the involvement of other animals. Several types of coronaviruses can infect animals and can be transmitted to other animals and people. There is no evidence that companion animals (e.g. dogs or cats)â€¯pose a risk of infection to humans. As a general precaution, it is always wise to observe basic principles of hygiene when in contact with animals."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. \n\nFor most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. \n\nYou can see these at [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)"
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. \n\nWe can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.\n\nLearn more about how to protect yourself at [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. \n\nPossible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. \n\nThe most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. \n(See [Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks))."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. \n\nSARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.\n\nWHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)). \n\nThe most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","1.  Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.\n\n2.  Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water\n\n3.  Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.\n\n4.  Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).\n\n5.  Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).\n\n6.  Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.\n\n7.  Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.\n\n8.  After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. \n\n9.  Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.\n\n10.  Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
What actions can staff and students take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in my school/childcare program?,"Encourage students and staff to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in childcare facilities."
What steps should my school take if a student or staff member shows symptoms of COVID-19?,You should establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or who arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible. Keep sick students and staff separate from well students and staff until sick students and staff can be sent home.
Should my school screen students for cases of COVID-19?,"Schools and childcare programs are not expected to screen children, students, or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. The majority of respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. If a community or school has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and will follow up on next steps."
What environmental cleaning procedures should my school take to keep staff and students healthy?,"Perform routine environmental cleaning. Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops) with cleaners that you typically use. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (e.g., keyboards, desks, remote controls) can be wiped down by students and staff before each use."
"What resources does CDC have available to share with staff, students, and parents?","Share resources with the school community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves:

CDCâ€™s health communication resources
CDC information on stigma and COVID-19
CDC information on COVID-19 and children
CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials, information on proper handwashing technique, and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits.
Other health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your school can use or share, such as the American Academy of Pediatricsexternal icon
CDCâ€™s information on helping children cope with emergencies
Stigma prevention and facts about COVID-19"
What actions should my school take if a sick student or staff member attended school before being confirmed as a COVID-19 case?,"Local health officials may recommend temporary school dismissals. Local health officialsâ€™ recommendations for the scope (e.g., a single school, a full district) and duration of school dismissals will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and the specific cases in the impacted community. Dismissals may be 14 days or longer, depending on the situation in your community.
Schools should work with the local health department and other relevant leadership to communicate the possible COVID-19 exposure to the school community. This communication to the school community should align with the communication plan in the schoolâ€™s emergency operations plan. In such a circumstance, it is critical to maintain confidentiality of the student or staff member as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act.
If a child or staff member has been identified with COVID-19, school and program administrators should seek guidance from local health officials to determine when students and staff should return to schools and what additional steps are needed for the school community. In addition, students and staff who are well but are taking care of or share a home with someone with a case of COVID-19 should follow instructions from local health officials to determine when to return to school."
What should I do if my school experiences increased rates of absenteeism?,"If your school notices a substantial increase in the number of students or staff missing school due to illness, report this to your local health officials."
Should I close our school/childcare program if there's been COVID-19 cases in my school?,"You may need to use temporary school dismissals of 14 days, or possibly longer, if a student or staff member attended school before being confirmed as having COVID-19. Any decision about school dismissal or cancellation of school events should be made in coordination with your local health officials. Schools are not expected to make decisions about dismissal and event cancellation independent of their local health officials. Dismissal and event cancellation decisions should be considered on a case-by-case basis using information from health officials about the local conditions."
"If our school is dismissed, how long should we dismiss school for?","The length (duration), geographic scope, and public health objective of school dismissals may be reassessed and changed as the local outbreak situation evolves. At this time, the recommendation is for at least 14 days. This recommendation may be updated as the situation evolves."
Are there ways for students to keep learning if we decide to dismiss schools?,"Yes, many schools may use e-learning plans and distance learning options for continuity of education, if available. Your school or districtâ€™s emergency operations plan should have recommended strategies for ensuring continuity of education and may provide guidance on how to proceed during a school dismissal. In addition, you may be able to use and/or scale up approaches used in other situations when students have not been able to attend school (e.g. inclement weather, facility damage, power outages)."
"If I make the decision for a school dismissal, what else should I consider?","In the event of a school dismissal, extracurricular group activities and large events, such as performances, field trips, and sporting events should also be cancelled. This may require close coordination with other partners and organizations (e.g., high school athletics associations, music associations). In addition, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friendâ€™s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.

Ensure continuity of meal programs for your students. Consider ways to distribute food to students who receive free or reduced cost meals. Check with the US Department of Agriculture â€“ Food and Nutrition Service for additional information: https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/USDAfoodsPandemicSchools.external icon If there is community spread of COVID-19, design strategies to avoid distribution in settings where people might gather in a group or crowd. Consider options such as â€œgrab-and-goâ€ bagged lunches or meal delivery.

Consider alternatives for providing essential medical and social services for students. Continue providing necessary services for children with special healthcare needs, or work with the state Title V Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) Program."
"If we dismiss school, what do we need to consider when re-opening the building to students?","CDC is currently working on additional guidance to help schools determine when and how to re-open their buildings to students. If you need immediate assistance with this, consult local health officials for guidance."
"What should we do if a child, student, or staff member has recently traveled to an area with COVID-19 or has a family member who has traveled to an area with COVID-19?","Review updated CDC information for travelers, including FAQ for travelers, and consult with state and local health officials. Health officials may use CDCâ€™s Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings to make recommendations. Individuals returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials."
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    "
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on â€œHow does COVID-19 spread?â€
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    "
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. "
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  â€“ especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
 



Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. 

You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/"
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.

We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.
Learn more about how to protect yourself at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.

Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.

SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  (see Advice on the use of masks).

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.
"
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Pull down the maskâ€™s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask â€“ Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The â€œincubation periodâ€ means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  

To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. 

WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available.
"
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose"
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. "
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

Smoking
Wearing multiple masks
Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")
In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
What should I do if I have symptoms or have been exposed?,"Call  your healthcare provider, or call before going to the emergency room.
We have guidance available for people who have or think they may have COVID-19:
What to do if you have confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (PDF) 
What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (PDF)
What to do if you have symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have not been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (PDF)"
How do I get tested?,"If you have symptoms, call your healthcare provider.
Learn more about testing."
What's the current risk?,"The risk posed by a virus outbreak depends on factors including how well it spreads between people, the severity of the illness it causes, and the medical or other measures we have to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).

COVID-19 is spreading in several communities in Washington, the risk of exposure is increasing for people who live in our state.
Healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.
Those who have had close contact with persons with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.
Travelers returning from affected international locations where community spread is occurring are at elevated risk of exposure.
Our knowledge of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving. The risk assessment will be updated as needed."
How can people protect themselves?,"There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). This occurs through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Every person has a role to play. So much of protecting yourself and your family comes down to common sense: 

Washing hands with soap and water.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
Staying away from work, school or other people if you become sick with respiratory symptoms like fever and cough.
Following guidance from public health officials.
Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself.
"
Who is at Higher Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19?,"Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:

Older adults (65+)
Individuals with compromised immune systems
Individuals who have serious chronic medical conditions like:
Heart disease
Diabetes
Lung disease
If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or health condition, it is important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease, including: 

Isolate at home and practice social distancing.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or having been in a public place.
Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay away from large gatherings and crowds.
Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks.
It is also important that you listen to public health officials who may recommend community actions to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, especially if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.

For more information visit the CDC's website.
"
What should you do if you think you're sick?,"Call ahead: If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, and may have had contact with a person with COVID-19 or recently traveled to countries with apparent community spread, call your health care provider or local public health department first before seeking medical care so that appropriate precautions can be taken."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.

Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"We are aware of instances of animals and pets of COVID-19 patients being infected with the disease;\n\nAs the intergovernmental body responsible for improving animal health worldwide, the\n[World Organisation for Animal Health](https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/)\n\n(OIE) has been developing technical guidance on specialised topics related to animal health, dedicated to veterinary services and technical experts (including on testing and quarantine);\n\nThere is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Further evidence is needed to understand if animals and pets can spread the disease;\nBased on current evidence, human to human transmission remains the main driver;\n\nIt is still too early to say whether cats could be the intermediate host in the transmission of the COVID-19."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.

Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures **ARE NOT** effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:\nSmokingWearing multiple masks\n\nTaking antibiotics (See question 10 ""\n\n*Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*\n\n"")\n\n**In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early** to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHowever, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.\n\nUntil the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing."
Can COVID-19 be spread through coins and banknotes?,"There is currently no evidence to confirm or disprove that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through coins or banknotes. However, respiratory droplets expelled from an infected person can contaminate and persist on surfaces. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after touching any frequently-touched surface or object, including coins or banknotes. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose, if your hands are not cleaned."
How can I grocery shop safely in the time of COVID-19?,"When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products. There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging."
How to wash fruits and vegetables in the time of COVID-19?,"Fruits and vegetables are essential components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw."
Is COVID-19 airborne?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. **These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. **\n\nYou can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
"What is the state doing to protect our health? 
","California has been actively and extensively planning with our local public health and health care delivery systems. Here are some of the things we are already doing:  

As in any public health event, our Medical and Health Coordination Center has been activated and is coordinating response efforts across the state and preparing for possible community transmission. 
In coordination with the CDC, state and local health departments, we are actively responding to cases of COVID-19. 
The Public Health Department is supporting hospitals and local public health laboratories in the collection of specimens and testing for COVID-19. 
California activated the State Operations Center to its highest level to coordinate response efforts across the state. 
Governor Gavin Newsom requested the Legislature make up to $20 million available for state government to respond to the spread of COVID-19. 
California made available some of its emergency planning reserves of 21 million N95 filtering facepiece masks for use in certain health care settings to ease shortages of personal protective equipment. 
We are providing information, guidance documents, and technical support to local health departments, health care facilities, providers, schools, universities, colleges, elder care and congregate living facilities and childcare facilities across California. 
California obtained approval to provide meal service during school closures to minimize potential exposure to the coronavirus. These meals are available at no cost to low-income children â€“ and are not required to be served in a group setting â€“ to ensure kids receive nutritious meals while schools are temporarily closed. 
The state directed mass gatherings be postponed or cancelled to slow the spread of the virus. 
The Franchise Tax Board is providing a 90-day extension to file California tax returns for taxpayers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
CalTrans launched a statewide educational campaign on more than 700 electronic highway signs, urging all Californians to be more diligent about containing the spread of the virus.  
The state is allowing local and state legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still meeting state transparency requirements.  
The California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency released guidance for homeless assistance providers in the state. 
The California Department of Public Health is coordinating with federal authorities and local health departments that have implemented screening, monitoring and, in some cases, quarantine of returning travelers.  
In coordination with state and local health departments, we have actively managed suspect and confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients. 
California worked in partnership with the federal government to aid in the safe return of 962 Californians from the Grand Princess cruise ship. This mission centered around protecting the health of the passengers, and ensuring that when the passengers disembarked, the public health of the United States, the State of California, and partner communities was protected. 
24 million more Californians are now eligible for free medically necessary COVID-19 testing. 
The state is taking aggressive social distancing steps - bars, night clubs, breweries and wine tasting rooms should close and restaurants should focus on food delivery and takeout while maximizing social distancing for those who are inside their restaurant. 
California is recommending older Californians (65+) socially isolate in their homes.  
The state is providing safe, wrap around services to vulnerable residents who are isolating at home â€“ ramping up existing meal delivery and home visiting services.
The California Employee Development Department (EDD) is encouraging individuals who are unable to work due to exposure to COVID-19 to file a Disability Insurance claim. Californians unable to work because they are caring for an ill or quarantined family member can file a Paid Family Leave claim.  
The Governor removed the waiting period for unemployment and disability insurance for Californians who lose work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.  
EDD is also encouraging employers who are experiencing a slowdown in their businesses or services as a result of the Coronavirus impact on the economy to apply for an Unemployment Insurance work sharing program.  
The Governor declared a State of Emergency to make additional resources available, formalize emergency actions already underway across multiple state agencies and departments, and help the state prepare for broader spread of COVID-19.  
The California Department of Public Healthâ€™s state laboratory in Richmond and 20 other public health department laboratories now have tests for the virus that causes COVID-19. 
Twenty public health labs in California, including the Department of Public Health's state laboratory in Richmond, are now testing for the virus that causes COVID-19.
"
What is SARS-CoV-2? What is COVID-19?,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
Where do coronaviruses come from?,"Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans.

Bats are considered as natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to be a source. For instance, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats. More information on coronaviruses can be found on the ECDC factsheet."
Is this virus comparable to SARS or to the seasonal flu?,"The novel coronavirus detected in China is genetically closely related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died.

The current COVID-19 outbreak caused around 7â€¯000 reported cases in China during the first month after initial reports (January 2020), with a further 80 000 cases reported globally during the second month (February 2020). Of these first 87 000 cases, about 3 000 died. Cases are now being detected in Europe and across the globe. See the situation updates for the latest available information. 

While the viruses that cause both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are transmitted from person-to-person and may cause similar symptoms, the two viruses are very different and do not behave in the same way. ECDC estimates that between 15 000 and 75 000 people die prematurely due to causes associated with seasonal influenza each year in the EU, the UK, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This is approximately 1 in every 1 000 people who are infected. By comparison, the current estimated mortality rate for COVID-19 is 20-30 per 1 000 people.

Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be as transmissible as influenza if not more so. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity which in theory means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to COVID-19 infection."
How severe is COVID-19 infection?,"Preliminary findings indicate that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 20-30 per thousand people diagnosed. This is significantly less than the 2003 SARS outbreak. However, it is much higher than the mortality rate for seasonal influenza."
What is the mode of transmission? How (easily) does it spread?,"While animals are the original source of the virus, it is now spreading from person to person (human-to-human transmission). There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily and sustainably this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three more. The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets that people sneeze, cough, or exhale. The virus can also survive for several hours on surfaces such as tables and door handles.

The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated at between two and 14 days. At this stage, we know that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected show flu-like symptoms such as coughing.  There is evidence suggesting that transmission can occur from an infected person with no symptoms; however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by non symptomatic persons on the epidemic."
What are the symptoms ofÂ COVID-19 infection,"The virus can cause mild, flu-like symptoms such as:

fever
cough
difficulty breathing
muscle pain
tiredness
More serious cases develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock that can lead to death. "
Are some people more at risk than others?,"Generally elderly people and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms."
Are children also at risk of infection?,"Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild. A large study from China suggested that just over 2% of cases were under 18 years of age. Of these, fewer than 3% developed severe or critical disease."
